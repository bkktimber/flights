# Flights

A quick project to analyse the best way to travel across
the globe. 

## Open Data

This repository exploits [OpenFlight data](http://openflights.org/data.html) 
as its only data source.

## Prerequisites

The project is built with `Scala`. All you need to compile and run 
the project is listed as follows. The project itself is not 
specifically configured for any particular IDE so using 
just `sbt` to build and run the project is fine.

- [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/)
- [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html)
